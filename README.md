# apps-script-framework

__Coming soon !..__

Google Apps Script MVC Web framework for scripts published as Web App.
Is like Rails or Django for classic Web Apps.

With ability to: 
- generate pages from templates
- route requests to controllers
- render contexts
- expose APIs
and more

Upsides:
- May be useful in some cases, 
where Apps Script functionality is very convenient to be right in the Web App back-end,
- for quick prototypes

Downsides:
- Not for high loads (runtime limits apply)
- no possibility to link custom domain, ugly URL
